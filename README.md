# Arduino FCU for 3D Printed Airsoft HPA Engine

3D printed HPA engine running v1 FCU code. Two stage trigger similar to Steyr AUG, 11.1v lipo battery, Arduino Nano, HPA solenoid and temporary printed clasp to hold it all together. Tried only low RPS so far.

# Testing

Using a set of 3D printed mounts to enable hop up chamber testing. Means I can measure the perfect distance between the hopup chamber and nozzle resting point.

So far strongest contender for a body shell. Will fit all the parts inside without an issue, and I've always liked the Kriss Vector....
